### What I learned

This is my first project returning to HTML and CSS to get experience in app development with these languages*.

By far the most important thing I learned was reading off imported code, rather than code that I've already built. A skill required for team projects and collaborations to easily understand and build on projects.

And CSS.

### Continued development

CSS in particular is a pain to get right, by far the biggest roadblock to making this project, structuring itself could use some work, optimizations could be made and less boilerplate.

Moreover, my process of coding is extremely flawed and unstructured, picking off at random parts, instead of building the base then the design.
